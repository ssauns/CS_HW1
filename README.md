My code is about creating functions that can modify, find, add, and replace values in an one-dimensional array.

I first began my code by opening my input file in my code. After my input file is opened, I moved the number values from my input to be the ith terms in my array. My first function is to find an integer in an array. I wrote my code out of the main function. To test the code, I wrote it into the main function, using a random target to see if my code works. My second function is modifying a value in the array. I followed the same process. I used pair to access and compare two different values. My third function is adding an integer at the end of the array. The array was full because it was already a set size from the input value. I set my code up to assess if we could add a value at the end. This function will say "array is full". My foruth function is to replace a value with zero.

I have a header file. In my header file are the functions to modify and add an integer, as both functions pertain to question two. I did not complete question two for this assignment. I tried to create another source file with the try and catch blocks, but I could not figure it out.
